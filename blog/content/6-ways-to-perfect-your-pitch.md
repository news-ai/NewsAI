### 1. Proofread: Spelling & Grammar Check

You should *always* check to see if there are any grammar & spelling mistakes in your emails. Since you're pitching to people who write professionally, they will find these mistakes unprofessional. Thanks to technology, there's two tools that are able to assist you in checking your grammar. They are:

- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/): "makes sure everything you type is easy to read, effective, and mistake-free."
- [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/): "software automatically suggests 1000s of style improvements so you can breeze through your editing"

These two products are great to get a second opinion on your writing. If you don't have any other person to take a look at any grammatical errors that may be in your email, you should use this tool!

The great thing about Grammarly is their Chrome extension is amazing. You can get your grammar checked anywhere - even in email editors!

### 2. Test readability & length

Next, you should check how readable your email is. Email is something that is read quickly, and your writing should reflect that. It should be easy to read & be short. The reporter will be able to take a quick glance, easily read it, and understand your angle.

There's a product called [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) that helps. It lets you paste your email in, and suggest improvements that you could make in your writing.

### 3. Test your subject line

The subject line is important. It is important because a good subject line makes them want to open your email. It's the first contact they have with your pitch. Without a good subject line, your pitch will get lost in a sea of pitch emails reporters get.

There's a great tool called [Subject Line](http://www.subjectline.com/). You can paste your subject line & get feedback on how good it is. It compares it to its database of subject lines & how successful they were. I tested my subject line: "I love testing things" & got a good score!

### 4. Find the best time to send your pitch

A critical part of sending emails, is sending them at the right time. There are tons of studies to find the optimal time to send your pitch at. We wrote [one](https://www.newsai.co/blog/best-time-to-pitch-reporters/), but there have been a lot of different ones as well.

You have to know when reporters in your vertical are looking for pitches, and what time they usually check their emails. Emailing them at night might not be the best idea, since many people are more likely to archive emails on their phones. And, people check their emails first thing in the morning when they wake up.

### 5. Check if your pitch includes the critical components

Read your pitch again, and see if it includes all the critical things a reporter would want to know. They'd want to know:

1. Introducing yourself/client
2. Some context and present an opportunity
3. The "Ask"

First, introduce your client or yourself somewhere. Especially if the reporter isn't familiar with them. Establish their credibility.

Next, present an opportunity for the reporter to jump at. This could be a story opportunity, or an opportunity to meet an expert.

Lastly, the "Ask" is important, since it helps them know why you're reaching out.

### 6. Make sure you've incorporated the reporter

Personalize your email. Don't blast emails out without even the reporters name in them. Incorporate their personal details, and show them that you follow their work. You usually ignore emails that aren't addressed to you as well, don't you? I do too!
