Last week I wrote a piece on [How To Use Previous Press To Find New Influencers on Instagram](https://www.newsai.co/blog/use-previous-press-to-find-new-influencers/). I thought I would explore how to do what we did with Instagram, but with Twitter.

A lot of reporters use Twitter nowadays, so this is also pretty helpful in finding reporters that are similar. Any Twitter influencers work. You get the best results when the influencers/reporters are similar to each other. They have to be for a particular client or have some similarities. Ideally, you'd be looking to find influencers for a particular client.

Initially, we'd want to gather all the Twitter influencers or reporters that have engaged with our client in the past. Gather all your media lists for a particular client (media lists with Twitter usernames) or find press/social media mentions (by influencers) they've gotten before. You'll be needing these.
