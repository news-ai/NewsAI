Getting press is helpful for all Brands & Companies. You don't have to hire a PR agency or a PR professional to get press for yourself. 

PR is an ongoing investment. Don't expect your numbers to blow up with one article. It rarely happens. You should see it as something you should invest time in on an ongoing basis. Make it a habit. It could be reaching out to reporters or being an expert for them in one of their articles. It's a great skill to learn, and helps gain your business credibility to others.

It's also a difficult skill to have. It's incredibly confusing how you're supposed to go about learning all aspects of PR. It's really easy to send the wrong pitch to the wrong reporter, and getting demotivated. I wanted to work on building up resources to help you learn the PR framework.

### 1. Reach Out To Reporters Yourself

At the beginning, you want to own your media contacts. Know who you are reporting to, and build a relationship with them.  When you use a PR agency at the beginning, you are using their connections & their media lists. In most cases they won't send you their media list, and you will most likely be looped out of the conversation with a reporter. It is time consuming and difficult to initially build your media contacts & a relationship with them, but in the long run it is worth the investment.

*Media list: a list with reporters contact information in them.*

It's worth the time to go through & understand what parts of your business are appealing to the reporter, and the audience you are targeting. You can test what kinds of messaging or interesting propositions of your business are intriguing to reporters.

Additionally, in the beginning you should try & reach out to brands yourself to reduce costs. PR agencies/consultants are costly. Just like everything, learn the basics of what works and what doesn't before hiring someone else to do it. You'll be able to make a much better decision in the future.

Journalists also like talking to founders. They get approached by a lot of PR contacts, so being a founder & sending them a pitch sets you aside (to some degree). It's great to know someone has done their research and their work.

### 2. Create a Profile For The Right Reporters

Finding the right reporters completely depends on who your target audience is: consumers or enterprise. You should be targeting publications that fit that criteria. At the beginning getting a mention in the New York Times might not help you a lot if you're an enterprise company, but getting into a vertical specific publication might.

Don't spend your time trying to get into the largest publications. You should find publications that fit your target size, and what your target customers would read. Ask them where they read their news, and use those as inspiration! You're more likely to find the same people or companies to buy your product/service or increase your exposure from those publications.

If you target the wrong reporters, your pitch will most likely be deleted right away. An average reporter gets 50+ pitches per day, and so you might not get anywhere if you don't pick the right reporters. They usually don't have time to give you feedback either. They are unlikely to build a relationship with you if you don't even take the time to learn their work (which, makes total sense - I wouldn't do that either).

For this step, you could do an exercise to write down who you're targeting: 1-10 sized companies or 14-16 year old teenagers. Write down the criteria that makes sense for your business, and then look for publications that fit this criteria.

For example, if my criteria was small or mid-sized tech startups - I would write down Recode, TechCrunch, etc. If I was to target 14-16 year old teenagers, I wouldn't try get mentions in New York Times... maybe BuzzFeed or Mashable. Do 14-16 year olds even know the domain for New York Times? Probably not.

**Know your goals.** Don't look stupid in-front of reporters.  [They talk](https://twitter.com/dearpr?lang=en). You really don't want to look bad infront of reporters.

### 3. Become a domain experts

If you start getting to know the reporters & interacting with them, they could come to you when they need expert advice. Becoming an expert to particular reporters is useful, since then you get mentioned in stories more frequently & they are more likely to take story requests from you (quid pro quo situation).

A great service for this is called [HARO](https://www.helpareporter.com/) (Help a Reporter Out). You might or not might have heard of this, it's a service where reporters/bloggers post requests on what they need publicly. If you fit their request, you can email them and you might be noted in a story! It's a good way to increase awareness to a reporter that you & your company exist. This is helpful in building a relationship with them!

### 4. Build a relationship

If you can, try and build long lasting relationship with journalists. This is a hard thing to do, especially if you have limited time. This is also difficult to do, some people have an easier time building a relationship with reporters. If you are great at networking & getting to know people, this is an advantage that will help you build relationships with reporters.

If you're not, find reporters that share similar interests to you. These similar interests can help you build a relationship with them, since you'll have common points to speak about.

Building a relationship could also mean doing something for them at the beginning. You don't have to pitch them your business right away, but help them with a task they are looking for. Then, in the future when you email them, they'll be very likely to read your pitch.

### 5. Write pitches

We have a couple sample pitches that you can [use](https://www.newsai.co/blog/5-best-pitches-from-around-the-internet/) or learn from. They outline the majority of what the structure should look like for your pitches.

I have pitches from many different verticals. Feel free to get in touch with me, and I'll send over pitches if you'd like (abhi at newsai.co). I can also look over material for you.

### 6. Measure, measure, measure.

Imagine the importance of measuring PR like you measure sales. You should know which reporters are opening and replying to your pitches, and which kinds of publications are responding the best to you. If some publications are giving you positive responses, then contact publications that are similar to that.

Measure all the steps. Who's responding to me, what kind of pitch is working, what part of my business is most appealing to this publication, etc.

### 7. Never stop testing

Keep testing to see what kinds of publications and reporters are responding to you. Data is the most helpful at the beginning - especially when you're not a PR person. It can be the signal you use to understand whether you're heading in the right direction or not. Ideally, you'd know what kind of reporters are reporting to your pitches, and what pitches are doing the best.

We've created a guide for brands & companies to be able to do their own PR. We're releasing it soon, but email me for an advanced copy if you're looking to learn now (abhi at newsai.co).
