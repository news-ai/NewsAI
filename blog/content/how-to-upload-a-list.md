If you have your own excel sheets, we make it easy for you to seamlessly upload them onto our platform. First, click the "Upload from Existing" icon on the top right (shown below).

This will pop up a panel where you're able to give your media list a name (in this case "Sample sheet") and drop your excel sheet into the panel.

After the media list has been uploaded, you'll be brought to this page. Here you'll be able to assign each of the columns.
