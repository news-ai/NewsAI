Some of these blogs are great archives. They don't produce as much stuff anymore, but they have a lot of old blog posts that are worth reading. I'll try and put the ones I found were more niche at the top, and slowly go down to the more popular ones.

### 1. [PR New Pros](http://prnewpros.prsa.org/)

This blog has a lot of great content for people who are starting out in PR. PR pros share their experiences, and give great overviews of what the job and the industry entails. They also host weekly Twitter chats, which are amazing - [#npprsa](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23npprsa&src=typd).

### 2. [Digital PR - Higher Ed Marketing Journal](http://circaedu.com/hemj/category/digital-pr/)

### 3. [Axia PR](http://www.axiapr.com/blog)

### 4. [Morgan McLintic on Communications](http://www.morganmclintic.com/)

Great blog on a host of different topics and ideas that relate back to PR. From blog posts like [Five more lessons from starting a PR agency](Five more lessons from starting a PR agency) to [HARO under fire for unverified sources](http://www.morganmclintic.com/pr/2017/01/haro-under-fire-for-unverified-sources.html). Morgan shares a lot of different content on the site that's really worth reading!

### 5. [Bad Pitch Blog](http://www.badpitchblog.com/)

### 6. [PR In Your Pajamas](http://prinyourpajamas.com/)

### 7. [Social Pro Daily](http://www.adweek.com/category/social-pro-daily/)

### 8. [Flatiron Communications](http://flatironcomm.com/theflack/)

### 9. [Deirdre Breakenridge](http://www.deirdrebreakenridge.com/)

### 10. [Public Relations Tag on Medium](https://medium.com/tag/public-relations)

This is kind of cheating. But, there's just so many articles from so many different people here. It's not totally curated, but Medium usually has high quality content. There's a niche group of PR professionals who write to medium. There's a lot of new content on there everyday - worth checking out!

### 11. [Public Relations Defined](http://prdefinition.prsa.org/)

This site was created "to modernize the definition of public relations". It's not maintained anymore, but it has some incredible and thoughtful content on it. It was written by a lot of different people at the PRSA, and it's a great resource to learn about how they approached the definition of PR.

### 6. [Spin Sucks](http://spinsucks.com/)

### 7. [PR Daily](http://www.prdaily.com/)
