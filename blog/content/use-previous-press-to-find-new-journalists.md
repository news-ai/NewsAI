You just got a new client, and you need to start building a new media list for them. I was wondering if there were ways to use press they already had about them to build a new list. I started with a client name, and was able to end up with a new media list.

### Find All Mentions Your Client Has Gotten

There's a variety of different products you're able to use to find all mentions your client has gotten online. You're able to use [Mention](https://mention.com/) or [Google News](https://news.google.com) and many other tools. There's a lot of ways to solve this isssue. It depends on if the mentions are on social media or are on blogs/publications. 

On Google News, you can put your client name in quotations to get good results. For example, if your client was Equinox, you'd be able to search "Equinox" in the Google News box. This would give you posts that only mentioned the word "Equinox".

### Categorize Them Into A Spreadsheet

Now, add all of these articles into a spreadsheet. You need to document at least the author's name, and the publication's name. For example, I found an article written about Equinox on Women's Wear Daily.

So, in my Excel sheet I have 4 columns: Article Name, Author(s), Publication, URL, and Author Beat. Here's what I added as a row in my Excel sheet.

- Article Name: Equinox Opens Group Fitness Boutique in N.Y.
- Authors: Andrew Nodell
- Publication: Women's Wear Daily
- URL: http://wwd.com/eye/lifestyle/equinox-opens-group-fitness-boutique-nyc-10851598/
- Author Beats: Lifestyle & Parties

You should either take all press (if client is small) or selected press and document them on an Excel sheet. It would be useful to get a diverse amount of reporters and press so you're able to know all the beats they've been mentioned in.
