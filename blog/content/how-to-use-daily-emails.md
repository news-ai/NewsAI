Here's a GIF on how to get daily emails from our platform! Daily emails are just emails we send you everyday with updates to what your social media influencers have been posting in the last day. We pick the best posts from each of your lists. We update you on posts from Instagram, Twitter, or their blogs.

Daily emails are enabled by default. However, if you're not getting them & want to enable them go to the "Settings" page in the menu bar on the left (shown below)

Next, toggle the "Subscribe to Emails" setting. If it's toggled to the right it means you're subscribed, and on the left means not.
