Last week I wrote a piece on [How To Use Previous Press To Find New Journalists](https://www.newsai.co/blog/use-previous-press-to-find-new-journalists/). I thought I'd explore how to do the same for social media influencers. If your campaigns are build around social influencers, the question to ask is: how can I use influencers on my list already to find more.

I'm going to limit this to two social networks: Instagram and Twitter. Those are the ones which are incredibly popular right now. Discovering influencers on Snapchat is pretty difficult right now, but I'll post a follow up on the methods you can use to find Snapchat influencers soon.

### Instagram

### Twitter
