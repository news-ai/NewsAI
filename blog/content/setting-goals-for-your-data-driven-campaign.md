Last week I wrote a piece on [How To Start Your First Data Driven PR Campaign](https://www.newsai.co/blog/how-to-start-your-data-driven-campaign/). I started thinking about how I could come up with realistic goals (for a PR campaign) that I could reach, and goals I could work towards. When certain campaigns are not going as planned, I could use those goals to adjust my outreach, and learn from data.

Having goals and access to data (from previous post), you should be able to change and adjust your campaign strategy when you realize that you won't be able to meet those goals. You're able to do this fairly quickly, and not have to wait weeks/months/years (depending on length of campaign) in order to revise your plans. It's important to have realistic goals, since you can use them to pivot your plans when you need to.

### Minimum and Outstanding Goals

Similar to many experiments, I found having minimum and outstanding goals useful. The minimum goal for a particular metric is what you need to accomplish by the end of the campaign. If you're not going to meet this goal by the end, you need to adjust and revisit your campaign plan. This is so by the end of your campaign you can meet at least the minimum goal.

### Adjusting Your Campaign

Data is most useful to you when the campaign is still running. You're able to see how much progress you've made towards your goal. It's critical you can measure how successful your campaign is. In a measurement sense, the success of your campaign breaks down to how each of your metrics are doing. If each of your metrics are as expected (or better) then you are working towards a successful campaign. If not, you need to understand why it isn't working and adjust your plan.
