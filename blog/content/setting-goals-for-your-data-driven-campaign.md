Last week I wrote a piece on [How To Start Your First Data Driven PR Campaign](https://www.newsai.co/blog/how-to-start-your-data-driven-campaign/). I started thinking about how I could come up with realistic goals (for my pr campaign) that I could reach, and goals I could work towards. When certain campaigns are not going as planned, I could use those goals to adjust my outreach, and learn from data.

Having goals and access to data (from previous post), you should be able to change and adjust your campaign strategy when you realize that you won't be able to meet those goals. You're able to do this fairly quickly, and not have to wait weeks/months/years (depending on length of campaign) in order to revise your plans. It's important to have realistic goals, since you can use them to pivot your plans when you need to.
