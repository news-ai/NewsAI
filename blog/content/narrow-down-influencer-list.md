Everyone is an fashion influencer nowadays, but no two fashion influencers are created the same. Once you carefully curate a massive list of influencers whose style matches your brand's message, and working on limited influencer budget, how do you know which influencer is generating content that is above-and-beyond the average?

I started out with the assumption that an influencer with more followers should be getting more likes/comments on average, and you can generate a trend line based on a large enough sample size on what is the average number of likes/comments an influencer with X followers should be getting.

How I did it: I generated a trend line with a fairly small sample of 47 fashion influencers of various follower count (20K - 750k) after collecting a day's (November 6th) worth of likes, comments, # of posts of all the influencers. After generating the graph, I sorted the influencers by those above the line and those below it.

The Y-Axis is the # of Likes/# of posts.
The X-Axis is the # of followers.

If one influencer posts way more than another, then the total amount of likes would be skewed for the one that posts more, so I averaged daily # of likes with # of posts.

I also made one of comments to followers where:

The Y-Axis is the # of Comments/# of posts.
The X-Axis is the # of followers.

You can easily generate this graph with your own media lists, too!

I've made this graph with the [Trendline](/how-to-make-an-instagram-timeline/) generating tool in the [NewsAI Tabulae platform](https://www.newsai.co/), a CRM for PR that keep your media lists in sync with one another and help you keep up to date with the content generated by your contacts.

There's a free 7-days trial (no credit card collected) and you can try recreating this graph with your own media lists of fashion influencer handles (Tabulae will fetch the likes/posts/comments counts for you!).

While this is only a snapshot of one day, I am curious to see what sort of pattern will arise with data collected over a couple months, but that's another blogpost for another day.

May the odds be ever in your favor.
