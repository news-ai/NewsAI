60% of journalists in the US use Twitter. A lot of them are interacting and sharing content on a day-to-day basis. They share articles they are interested in, and articles they write themselves.

Even if they don't use Twitter lately, it's still a good repository on information about them.

### What links they are sharing on Twitter

People usually share posts that they are interested in, and share new stories within their beat. 

### Monitor when they are asking for experts or have problems

In addition to HARO, Twitter is also a good way to help out reporters. Reporters tweet about experts they're looking for or problems they are having. Look through their tweets and evaluate what kinds of experts they are looking for. It'll be helpful in understanding what kinds of stories they're writing in the future, and what kinds of problems they are having.

### Check who are sharing their articles

Search articles they write or their username in Twitter Search. Social sharing has become immensely important when new posts come out.
