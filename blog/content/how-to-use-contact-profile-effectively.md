A Contact Profile is generated for every row in your List. There are a couple key features you should know to make sure you are using the profile to the most extent you could be.

### Social media accounts you add to the contact generate timeseries graphs

When you add a Twitter/Instagram, Tabulae starts pulling in data. If you click on the line chart icon next to the social handle, you can see a timeseries graph of the contact.

### Custom Fields

If the list a contact belongs to has custom columns (e.g. beat, contacted, etc), then you can edit that field on the left.

### RSS feeds

You can follow [RSS feeds](/how-to-add-rss-feeds-to-contacts/) and edit it in settings. Protip: WordPress sites and Tumblr generates RSS feeds if you simply add /feed or /rss at the end of the domain.
