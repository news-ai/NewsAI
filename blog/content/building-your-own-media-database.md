As you grow as an agency, so do the amount of journalists and influencers you work with. It becomes difficult to keep up to date with what each of them writing, and organize who you know in your excel sheets. Also, your agency probably has a subscription to a media database, which lets you find journalist contacts and expand your lists.

- Retain institutionalized knowledge

When your account executives leave, you lose a lot of information on who they know and communications they have had with them.

- Your agency's own Linkedin
