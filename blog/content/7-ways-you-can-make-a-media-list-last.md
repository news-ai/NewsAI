### 1. Label your media list well

Adding extra information about your media list will help it updated in the future. Adding more information at the beginning helps you recycle lists later on. This could be information like:

1. What client is the list for?
2. What type of contacts are in this list? Are they all fashion bloggers or tech reporters or generally mixed?
3. What campaign did you run using this list?
4. When did you create this list?

The last one will be useful in the long run - adding a date will make it easy to know how many contacts become outdated.

### 2. Add their social information

You can quickly look them up when you need to stay updated on what they’re writing on (or forgot what they write about!). Sometimes using an email makes it difficult to search for them online, but social information will always help you identify them.

You can have a column for either their Linkedin, Blog, Twitter or any other social medium. Having social media information is as useful as having their emails nowadays! Twitter has become  popular in the journalism community. Instagram in the lifestyle/fashion world.

Besides, some PR professionals have also began pitching/talking to reporters via Twitter. Since reporters get a huge volume of pitches a day - this could be useful for you!

### 3. Don’t store things that get out of date within a week

If you're storing their followers count, likes count, or other metrics  then this will be hard to keep up to date for you. These will create more noise than be useful for you in your media lists. Store a ballpark instead!

### 4. Don’t rely just on the media database you’re using

Media databases sometimes have incorrect information since reporters are moving around a lot. It’s useful for you to cross-reference social networks to validate they’re still working in that position or the same beat!

### 5. Consider putting them in a contact database

Since you have a lot of information that links to their social media or gets outdated - putting them in a contact database could be helpful. There are generally helpful if you have a lot of lists with a lot of different contacts. You can recycle contact information and use them in the future as well.

Not only that, but it also helps you keep your information up to date and let the software assist you in keeping it up to date.

### 6. Have a section on notes

If you learn something about them through your interactions or find out something about them through social media - you should note it! It’d be useful to have these in the future when you’re looking back at these contacts. These notes usually last even if people move publications.
