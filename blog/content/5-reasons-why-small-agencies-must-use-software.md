Small agencies are usually low on staff & therefore time. But, a lot of small agencies aren't using software to improve their workflows. Why? Software tools help you get more out of your time. You're able to automate small parts of your job and gain a lot of value from that automation.

In my experience, small agencies are often worried about automation. It could be harmful to you if you aren't careful. It's easy to automate different parts and not see results. You want to be personalized. You want to build relationships, and not just spam everyone. That makes total sense.

You shouldn't automate everything, especially the key parts of your business. But, that doesn't mean you shouldn't use them at all. These products are built to make you more productive.

From our side (a software company), our aim is to make you (as a small agency) more productive. We want to hear how we can improve your workflow, and see what features or processes could be beneficial to you. We don't want to take away your ideologies or make you spam reporters. We want to help you get more done with the time you have.

From observing a lot of different PR agencies, there are some optimizations we think could help you be a better business. We go through them here.

### 1. Use Software to Send Out Pitches to Reporters

This doesn't mean automate the entire workflow. This doesn't have to do with bulk pitches, but to use technology to help you with your work. Using a CRM to send out your pitches, you're easily able to filter & know when you last contacted a particular reporter.

_A CRM is just a customer relationship management tool. Basically, in PR, a platform for you to keep your reporter contacts._

Sure, you're able to do this through Gmail or Outlook, but it doesn't easily integrate with your Excel sheet. Having all this information in one view is immensely helpful. You're able to create queries & easily know which reporters you haven't reached out to in a while, it's helpful even for relationship building. It's hard to realize the advantages of having these small integrations, they help me on a day-to-day basis.

Querying through your own data is an amazing optimization. The more useful data you can query, the larger benefit you have. As you get larger clients, your data becomes increasingly more useful to you.

Most of our customers send out pitches to individual reporters. They have told me how useful our "Last Contacted" feature is. They don't want to spam reporters, and now they can be conscious of that since it integrates right into their media lists. It's a small feature that's helped them better reach out to individuals in their media lists.

There are definitely small things that you can integrate into your pitch workflow that would make you more effective.

### 2. Measure the success on the pitches you send

Measurement is becoming an important part of the PR workflow. The industry is moving towards becoming more data-driven as the bigger players in the industry start using big data solutions. It's difficult for smaller agencies to use these tools since they're expensive. You don't have to be constrained to expensive tools in order to collect & be more effective using data. There definitely are cheaper ways to collect & use data.

Initially, it can be useful to know which reporters are responding positively to particular pitches, and to particular clients. You can be more intelligent about your future outreach by looking at data. It's very time consuming to do this manually. It's a hard process and a lot of very tedious Excel work.

Software tools are useful for this. They're able to measure and make predictions for you. You just have to look through the data and make the decision. It saves you a lot of time by doing the heavy lifting for you.

Imagine just being able to filter down and seeing which reporters are engaging with your material immediately after you send your pitch. You're immediately able to know which reporters are clicking on your clicks and downloading your attachments. _There's no guessing game._

In the long run, you'll be able to know which reporters are interested in your materials vs the reporters that never open your emails. You can narrow down and create better media lists, and know which reporters you have created relationships with.

Additionally, it also helps you do more intelligent follow-ups, so you're not shooting the dark. Why annoy journalists who clearly aren't interested, right? No point in following up with everyone.

_We let you do all of these tasks in one place in our [CRM built for PR Professionals](https://www.newsai.co/). I'd love to help you get started or answer any questions you may have (email: abhi at newsai.co)._

### 3. Centralize all the reporter contacts you know in one places

For us, this has been the most helpful feature. Being able to have a central database of everyone your agency has contacted is immensely useful. You're able to go in and search reporters that are already in your Excel sheets. It helps you do queries like, everyone we've contacted who works at New York Times or works in Fashion.

Additionally, you don't have to update contacts in different lists. You can update a single contact in one particular list, and it updates it everywhere! No more emailing everyone when bounce backs happen.

Anyone in your team is able to go in and make changes to contacts in particular lists. When you are ready to email reporters on that list, the contact information will be up to date.

### 4. Record all the pitches you send in one place

Recording communications with reporters are important. It's helpful for everyone in your agency to be able to see what was said to particular reporters, and what your relationship with them is. If there's someone who has worked with them at your agency, why not speak to them before reaching out to them?

You could do all this without using software, and shoot everyone a message asking them if they know this reporter. But, that's time wasted for everyone.

You don't have to ask anyone at your agency for information, it is just readily available to you. Definitely helps you become more productive, and more informant about communications at your agency.

### 5. It'll be easier as you scale up in the future

All of these reasons will help you easily scale up your business as you hire in the future. Everyone who starts working at your agency will have access to all this information on their first day.

Imagine that. Your new employee logins into your CRM, and is able to see all the reporters you've already contacted. AND the reporter information they are looking at is up-to-date, not the wrong excel sheet.

We wrote more about this in our article [Why Your Agency Needs to Build Their Own Media Database](https://www.newsai.co/blog/building-your-own-media-database/). The basic idea is to keep your institutional knowledge well structured. If it is structured & someone leaves your agency, you'll have an easier time trying to understand and use that knowledge.

Having structured information basically, means using the same basic framework to order that information. For example, this could be using the same columns across all your media lists, and keeping them in particular folders on Google Drive. If someone leaves your agency, you'll be able to find that media list in the right folder and be able to understand where everything is. It's hard to do right (_that's why software is great!_).
