I was intrigued in researching what the best time to pitch reporters was. I decided to take a look at emails I've sent in the past, and other posts by PR professionals and companies in the past. I found rougly 15 different studies/blog posts that explored the best time and day to send an email.

I've taken different hypothesis from these posts in understanding what the best time is. I'll try lay out the ones I thought were interesting.

#### Journalist Planning Meetings

According to Axia PR, "many media outlets have planning meetings between 8:30-9:30 a.m. and again between 2:30-3:30 p.m." [1]. This is probably going to be specific to your industry, but it is something you should keep in mind. If you know when they pitch to their editors, you will be able to predict when they're probably looking for stories.
