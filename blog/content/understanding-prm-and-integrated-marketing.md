As someone still learning about PR, I've been finding more and more PR agencies that become integrated marketing agencies. At first, they seemed a little confusing to me. I thought the key advantage of a PR agency was being experts at PR, and integrating the different aspects of marketing would reduce that competitive advantage. However, I did not account for the direct business outcomes that the integration would bring for the client. The key advantages of integrating all the marketing communications sent by a particular company seems interesting, since you'll be able to control their voice across all channels.



"Growing diversity among products, consumers, and media make for an increasingly competitive marketplace that challenges organizations to use a wide range of tools to achieve core marketing objectives, and to do so effectively and efficiently. Thatâ€™s where IMC comes into play" (Friedman, 3).
