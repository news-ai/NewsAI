I read a post last week that discussed ["The Unbundling Of Excel"](http://tomtunguz.com/unbundling-of-excel/). It went through how most business applications at a lot of different companies around the world relied on Excel for everything. But, now there's a lot of software platforms that are replacing each of the niche use-cases of Excel. The author argues that it's similar to how Craigslist was unbundled into Airbnb, Etsy, and any other companies. The author says "Excel has done a phenomenal job educating hundreds of millions of people about the power of software". Now that those professionals are educated in the power of technology, a lot of those specific tasks will be automated my niche platforms.

As a company grows larger, "teams grow and specialize, collaboration becomes more important, and so does control", and there needs to be an evolution in the company's software chain. This "evolution in a companyâ€™s needs creates an opportunity for dedicated workflow software to replace former Excel use cases". Excel was a great solution for the majority of business use-cases, but as more and more manual things become automated, it seems easier and more efficient to use web platforms to automate those tasks. The same manual functions can be replaced by platforms for lower cost, and more insight.

Media lists are becoming "unwieldy and burdensome", and over time they decrease in value unless they are maintained and kept up to date. They are easy to organize at the beginning, but hard to maintain over time as your contact lists grow.
