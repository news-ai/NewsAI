On our platform, you can assign a client name attribute to a list so you can easily find it in the client directory.

First, you click into a list and assign a Client name by click on the "Add Tag & Client" icon (shown below).

Then, you can click the menu icon on the top left, and find them under the "Client Directory" tab.
