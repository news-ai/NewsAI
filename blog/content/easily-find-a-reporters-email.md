Sometimes it's difficult to find emails of reporters you're trying to reach out to. We totally understand that it's a problem! We face the same issues when we're looking for contact information. There are services that help you find email addresses, but those are quite costly.

In our struggle we found some tips that could be useful for you as well:

### Check their Twitter account

A lot of journalists have began to put their emails in their Twitter descriptions. For example:

<img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/newsai-main-site/blog/easily-find-a-reporter-email/sample_twitter.png" width="350px" alt="Sample Twitter">

It's becoming more and more common. Making it easy for them to get tips/stories from other Twitter users. To find their Twitter user a good Google query is:

- "<i>First Name</i> <i>Last Name</i> <i>Publication Name</i> Twitter".

If they have a Twitter account, it is most likely to pop up at the top. In this case, I googled "Yaron Steinbuch New York Post Twitter" to find his Twitter account. Another option is to just search on the Twitter website.

### Google their full name and publication domain name

There are a couple ways you could use Google to find emails of particular reporters. First, you can google this phrase:

- "First Name Last Name @publication.com"

An example: "Yaron Steinbuch @nypost.com".

You should be able to easily scroll through the first page, and find their email. It could be in a press release they write, or in a blog post comment.

Another way would be the specifically check on their publication website if it is listed anywhere. For this you could try a couple formats:

- "site:publicationname.com + firstname.lastname [at] publicationname.com"
- "site:publicationname.com + firstnamelastname [at] publicationname.com"
- "site:publicationname.com + firstname [at] publicationname.com"
- "site:publicationname.com + lastname [at] publicationname.com"

An example: "site:nypost.com + yaron.steinbuch [at] nypost.com"

In the examples above use "@" instead of "[at]".

### Find email format

If you have contacted anyone at their publication before, chance is that they use the same format. For example, a lot of journalists at New York Post have the format:

- "First Letter of First Name + Last Name @nypost.com.

An example: "ysteinbuch@nypost.com".

Not every publication follows the same format (it's harder to find a strict format at larger publications).

Once you have an email, you can validate it. There's a service by Email Hippo that allows you to put an email in, and see if it is valid or not. [This](https://tools.verifyemailaddress.io/) website helps you achieve that. Once you find their email on Google - just run it through this website & see if it is still active or not.

### Use our free tool!

To make this whole process easier, we built our own tool that you could use for free! It takes the learnings we have above, and finds their email. You could use the tool for free on this website: [Whose Email](http://whose.email). It looks like this:

<a href="http://whose.email"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/newsai-main-site/blog/easily-find-a-reporter-email/whose_email.png" width="450px" alt="Sending Emails"></a>

You're able to put in the First Name, Last Name, and Domain Name of the publication and get an email out. It'll go through all the email formats (more than we discussed above) and try and find the ones that are valid.

We're going to be building lots of other free tools for you to use. If you enjoy using any of them, subscribe below!
