In this pitch, the contact makes an initial contact with a reporter. Caroline, a PR professional, in her article [How to Write a Media Pitch (with Examples)](http://circaedu.com/hemj/how-to-write-a-media-pitch-with-examples/) shared this pitch:

```
Hi [First Name],

A recent report pointed to the frightening reality that hackers using ransomware on medical devices could pose the biggest–and most dangerous–cyber security threat in 2016, with insulin pumps and pacemakers being some of the devices most vulnerable to these risks. For this reason, I wanted to see if you were interested in speaking with [First Name], a leading encryption and cybersecurity expert, DARPA contractor, and a professor in NJIT’s Computer Science program. He has been conducting research on security and homomorphic encryption of embedded medical devices and can discuss the severity of this looming threat and the ways that we can leverage new protection techniques against this potentially fatal new cybercrime tactic.

Please let me know if you’re interested. Thanks for your time.

From this I learnt:

- Find the right reporter at a publication (or none of the text would have made sense to them)
- Be specific about the problem
- Give a short background of why your expert is impressive & relevant
- Pitch experts that are relevant now (Caroline included a "recent report")
