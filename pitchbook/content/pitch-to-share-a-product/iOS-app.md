Hi [First Name],

I’m [full name], founder of a London-based startup called [name + link to website], and I think you may be interested in our new product. We’ve developed a GPS-powered app that helps drivers instantly see how much they’re spending on petrol with each journey they make, and whilst there are similar apps out there (e.g. xxx and xxx), this is the first time an app has been created that uses up-to-date, real-time data from local service stations around the world.

We are releasing the Android version next week, and we expect the iOS version to be approved shortly after. I’ve attached a few screenshots of what the app looks like, and here’s a link to a video that demos exactly how it works.

I thought I’d give you first refusal to review this app before contacting other publications. If you could let me know if you’re keen to learn more, I’d appreciate it.

Thanks a lot for your time.

This shares a product that gives a reporter exclusive to write about it. It gives the journalist plenty of time to take a look before it is released. What I learnt from this:

- Avoid Buzzwords. Be direct
- Short & to the point
- Share link to the website or to the product
- Acknowledge similar apps (so they can reference market)
- Attach social details at the bottom
- Politely let me know if it's an exclusive or not
