This pitch was shared by a PR professional. It's by Elena, who runs [Cross Border Communications](http://crossborderpr.com/). She wrote an article called [Sample Media Pitch Letter: Highlighting Your Product](http://prinyourpajamas.com/media-pitch-sample/). It focuses more around a consumer product that is shipped (physical product).

Dear Editor,

I think your readers would appreciate our new website called www.monthlysocks.com.

We deliver a brand new pair of cushy men’s dress socks every month by mail – just like a magazine subscription. For about $6 a month including shipping anywhere in Canada and the US, subscribers have the benefit of having at least one matched pair of socks in their drawer, eliminating the panic of having to buy them at the airport drugstore.

Jude, a customer, says: "I thought the idea of getting socks in the mail was funny, whimsical, and practical. How many gifts can you say that about? I got a subscription for my husband who, like most of us, always intends to buy new socks but just never gets around to it. I can’t tell you how many times we’ve been out, the shoes come off, and there are his toes, a glowing white beacon of embarrassment. My husband was a little skeptical about this service-until the first pair of socks arrived. They’re very well made, soft, and the padding on the bottom feels great. I know because I’ve 'borrowed' them several times, as has my daughter."

I would be happy to send you a sample so you can credibly prove to your readers that this is in fact a great product and service.

I appreciate your time and consideration for what www.monthlysocks.com has to offer. If you’re interested in learning more, please email Elena Verlee at email@address.com or call me at 123-4567-890.

This, to me, seemed more emotional than the other ones. It had a long quote from a customer who had used it, and it provided a sample for the reporter. The testimonial made it stronger, since you're able to feel the impact of what the service does. I learnt:

- Sometimes long pitches are fine if they portray a story
- Giving away a sample if it's a sample product is good
- Going straight to the point at the beginning is powerful
