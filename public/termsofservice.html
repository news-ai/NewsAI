        <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on NewsAI's web site for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only.

        <p>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on NewsAI's web site; remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</p>

        <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by NewsAI at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</p>

Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
